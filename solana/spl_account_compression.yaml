    summary: |-
      Creates a new merkle tree with maximum leaf capacity of `power(2, max_depth)` and a minimum concurrency limit of `max_buffer_size`.

      Concurrency limit represents the # of replace instructions that can be successfully executed with proofs dated for the same root. For example, a maximum buffer size of 1024
      means that a minimum of 1024 replaces can be executed before a new proof must be generated for the next replace instruction.

      Concurrency limit should be determined by empirically testing the demand for state built on top of SPL Compression.

      For instructions on enabling the canopy, see [canopy].

    summary: |-
      This instruction takes a proof, and will attempt to write the given leaf
      to the specified index in the tree. If the insert operation fails, the leaf will be appended to the tree.
      It is up to the indexer to parse the final location of the leaf from the emitted changelog.
